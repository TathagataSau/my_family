                 <h3>Edge Computing-The Real Networking </h3>
                 <p>
                    Edge computing is what it sounds like: computing that takes place at the edge of corporate networks, with “the edge” being defined
                    as the place where end devices access the rest of the network – things like phones, laptops, robots, and sensors. The edge used to be a place where these devices connected so they could deliver data, and receive instructions to download software updates from a centrally located data center or the cloud.<\p>
                    <p>
                    With edge computing becoming mostly needed, it’s also important to make sure that the edge devices themselves don’t become a single point of failure. Network builders need to build redundancy and provide failover in order to avoid downtimes if a primary node goes down.</p><br>
                     The industry has already gone a long way toward addressing the demands of edge computing, and it is becoming mainstream. It is because of the importance of using real-time applications more and more. 
                    5g is a really hot topic when it comes to edge. Because you really can't do effective 5g without edge. these two really kind of go hand in hand.<br><p>
                     Now I can’t do edge without 5g but 5g especially is millimeter wave. 5g will be very dense in urban areas. It requires all these new radios all these new sites that are going to be put up. And the operators see that as an opportunity to have a basically a mini server in each of those sites to enable them to make money selling more services like network slicing is certainly one example um where you can deliver really high reliability and low latency for a use case like an autonomous car robotic surgery and then you have another slice for things like your toaster your IoT that probably doesn't need the same experience and then you have a slice for the massive mobile and  broadband speed. So I think 5g and edge and how those two are going to come together. But you know broad network coverage of 5g and then more devices that support it you kind of need both it's a chicken egg thing. And what a lot of people don't realize 5g is more than just millimeter wave in a downtown area it can be used on the rural spectrum the older you know 800 Megahertz spectrum so I think we're a couple years away um but I think uh yeah it's probably 2021 is when we're really going to start to see it hit mainstream. It's really those service providers that I think are going to leverage their footprint their network to enable all these new edge use cases. But I don't think they're going to be the only ultimate provider of whatever the cool thing is the startup community right just as we saw with 4g brought us cab facilities and 20,000 other things and mobile gaming that wasn't really possible before 4g I think edge plus 5g or even edge alone honestly is going to bring a whole new industry of startups most of which  we haven't even thought of yet there's so many different things you can do once you get that really low latency we're talking sub 1 millisecond latency that's possible with edge so thinking of VR it's almost real time not like now where you turn .<br></p>
                      The experience is slow and people are getting sick and so it's going to user in era of virtual reality augmented reality it's going to usher in an era of being able to do robotic surgery for rural hospitals with real-time access to doctor and urban center uh just so many, so many things I think, will be available.  If we sort of hearing you speak sort of changes my image of edge computing because we've always been focused on cloud so much that these last few years we've been really covering the cloud sector. When I think about there's this cloud monolith in the center and there's this little narrow ring around it called edge computing. In reality something like edge is this dense network that goes almost from the cloud all the way out its edge might be thought of as the rest of the network in addition to the central cloud is that accurate or not necessarily yeah that's actually a great way to describe it. Edge is going to be things like arm real low powered CPU devices these can be very inexpensive. When we think of cloud or compute many of us think of servers and a rack but edge could be our smart meter or our IoT device right there's going to be all of these devices that will come on to the network uh with edge and so yeah it's going to be fascinating. what we all bring on the network , now that's going to be enabled by edge.
